### Goal: 
Main goal of the project is to design and build a prototype of an innovative intelligent speech interaction system between loader cranes (Hiab XS 111) and their human operators. The presented research consists of implementing complex applications (interaction system) for crane control using hybrid neural networks for processing spoken natural languages and data. It also covers the development of mathematical and simulation models, and methods for computing crane operations and strategies in order to analyze many invented solutions to important problems. The research also includes the integration of the implemented speech-based interface with vision and sensorial systems, as it is a part of the main project in which the loader crane controlled by the developed ARSC (Augmented Reality & Smart Control) system will be used for experimental investigations of the system efficiency and increased operator's safety.

The main project is financed by the National Centre for Research and Development, Poland (NCBiR), under the Applied Research Programme.

### Implemented methods:
* Development of the complex applications (interaction system) for crane control using hybrid neural networks for processing spoken natural languages and complex data.
